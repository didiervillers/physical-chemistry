# Biatomic heteronuclear spectra and treatements

These spectra are measured at the "Universit√© de Mons-Hainaut" (now University of Mons UMONS), service de thermodynamique (now InFluX, laboratoire Interfaces et Fluides complexes) during the nineties, on a Bruker IFS 113V FTIR spectrometer, equiped with a gas cell. The original spectra doesn't existe anymore neither in JCAMP-DX format, but the (wavenumber, abosrbance) data are available. This folder contains data on carbon monoxyde CO and on hudrogen chloride HCl, together with some data treatments.
